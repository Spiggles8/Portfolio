My Portfolio Webpage
https://seanspiggle.tech

BUILT WITH: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript (using Forty by HTML5UP template).

This site was created in order to host my personal projects, detail out relevant information, and provide a contact form. 
Initially created used the Forty by HTML5UP template, but has been heavily modified to meet necessary needs. 
Additionally, FormSubmit.co is used to handle the contact form and will route that to message email address.
The site domain name was purchased from get.tech and hosting is provided by hostgator.com. 

Sections of the website are detailed below: 
1. Home
2. Projects
3. Skills
4. About Me
5. Contact Me


Future Updates/Considerations: 
1. I'm not 100% sold on the Teal color (could potentially change to some shade of blue).
2. I want to incorporate a dark mode button.
3. Could provide an animated video on project list. When one hovers over project it will show a video of it demonstrating the project. 
4. Ultimately, want to re-build this without the template to remove a large portion of unused code.
